# Dan's Dinner

# Setting
Cold Winter Raining day in San Francisco, with steep hills.

## Synopsis

An eager young lad wanders around the streets of San Francisco looking for something to eat. The adventures get out of hand when he runs into a cannibal, and the title suddenly starts to mean, Dan IS Dinner, instead of the Dinner that belongs to Dan.

Dan was the last human being eaten. But the cannibals were still hungry, what should we eat next? They asked to themselves... Suddenly, John looked very appetizing to the rest of the cannibals.
